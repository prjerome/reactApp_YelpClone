Building a react app using the create-react-app tool. This app is built as part of the web development course on codecademy.com. Attempting my own solutions first on master, when working with guidance I switch onto the codecademy_instructions branch, which I then merge back into master.

README below is from codecademy.com.

Create Project & Components:
Welcome to the first installment of the Ravenous project! Over the next couple of weeks, you’ll build a website called “Ravenous”, a Yelp-like clone.

In total, there will be four parts to this project:

Creating Static Components,
Passing Information to Components,
Setting the State of Ravenous Components,
Interacting with the Yelp API.


Here’s a quick overview of how Ravenous should function:

As a user, I should be able to search for restaurants,
As a user, I should be able to view a list of restaurants returned by the Yelp API,
As a user, I should be able to sort through restaurants using a filter,
The four projects will test your knowledge of JavaScript and React, all with the goal of building a Yelp-like clone. If you want to get a feel for what Ravenous can be, visit the Yelp website and search for restaurants in your area.

Finally, a few notes before getting started:

In each project, you’ll be presented with the intended, final outcome (of that project) in the Codecademy browser component.
You should expect to complete all four Ravenous projects on your personal computer using your preferred tools (terminal, text editors, etc.).
